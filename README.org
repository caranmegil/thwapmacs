* T.H.W.A.P. Emacs Configuration

I recently advised someone against rolling their own emacs configuration. Then I did it, because I'm smart like that.
As it turns out, yeah, I was wrong. The result of rolling my own is a nice fast distribution that is somewhat opinionated.

** Installation

Simply clone this repository as your ~/.emacs.d directory and start emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC
$ test -d ~/.emacs.d && mv ~/.emacs.d ~/emacs.d ; git clone https://github.com/fuzzy/thwapmacs ~/.emacs.d
$ emacs
#+END_SRC

This configuration bootstraps and uses straight.el to manage all package installations.

** Help

All keybindings set in this configuration are listed on the dashboard. Any other keybindings set by this configuration
were the recommended defaults from the package. If a non-default was chosen, it is listed in the help information on
the dashboar.
