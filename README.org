* T.H.W.A.P. Emacs Configuration

I recently advised someone against rolling their own emacs configuration. Then I did it, because I'm smart like that.
As it turns out, yeah, I was wrong. The result of rolling my own is a nice fast distribution that is somewhat opinionated.


** Help

All keybindings set in this configuration are listed on the dashboard. Any other keybindings set by this configuration
were the recommended defaults from the package. If a non-default was chosen, it is listed in the help information on
the dashboar.
